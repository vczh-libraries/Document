<Document><summary>The strategy to get the pointer to the reference counter from an object. If you get the same pointer multiple times from the same object by calling [M:vl.ReferenceCounterOperator`2.CreateCounter], than it is safe to convert a object pointer to a [T:vl.Ptr`1]. Currently for reflectable C++ types which inherit from [T:vl.reflection.DescriptableObject] it is yet. For others it is no.</summary><typeparam name="T">The type of the object.</typeparam><typeparam name="Enabled">[T:vl.Ptr`1] will always use [T:vl.YesType] as the second type parameter. This parameter is useful when you want to do partial specialization in the SFINAE way.</typeparam></Document>
