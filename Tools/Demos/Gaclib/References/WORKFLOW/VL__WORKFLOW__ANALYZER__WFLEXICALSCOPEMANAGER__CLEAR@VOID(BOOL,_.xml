 Set to true so that only scopes for types in Workflow modules are deleted.
 Set to false to also delete scopes for cached global types.
 If there is no new reflectable native type that is registered after the last call to <symbol name="Rebuild" docId="vl::workflow::analyzer::WfLexicalScopeManager::Rebuild@void(bool, ::vl::workflow::IWfCompilerCallback *)" declFile="WfAnalyzer.h" declId="FB$vl::workflow::analyzer::WfLexicalScopeManager::Rebuild@void(bool, ::vl::workflow::IWfCompilerCallback *)[decl0]"/>,
 using true for this argument saves times by reusing scopes created from global types.
