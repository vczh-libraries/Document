<Document symbolId="vl::presentation::controls::GuiControl" accessor="" category="Class" name="GuiControl"><summary>
 The base class of all controls.
 When the control is destroyed, it automatically destroys sub controls, and the bounds composition from the style controller.
 If you want to manually destroy a control, you should first remove it from its parent.
 The only way to remove a control from a parent control, is to remove the bounds composition from its parent composition. The same to inserting a control.
