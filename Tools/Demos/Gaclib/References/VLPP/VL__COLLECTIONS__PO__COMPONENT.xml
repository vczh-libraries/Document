 Component is a unit in sorting result.
 If a component contains more than one node,
 it means that nodes in this component depend on each other by the given relationship.
 It is not possible to tell which node should be place before others for all nodes in this component.
 If all nodes are completely partial ordered,
 there should be only one node in all components.
