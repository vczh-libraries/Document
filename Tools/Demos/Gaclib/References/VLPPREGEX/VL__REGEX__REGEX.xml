 Regular Expression. Here is a brief description of the regular expression grammar:
	1) Charset:
		a, [a-z], [^a-z]
 2) Functional characters:
		^: the beginning of the input (DFA incompatible)
		$: the end of the input (DFA incompatible)
		regex1|regex2: match either regex1 or regex2
	3) Escaping (both \ and / mean the next character is escaped)
		Escaped characters:
			\r: the CR character
			\n: the LF character
			\t: the tab character
			\s: spacing characters (including space, \r, \n, \t)
			\S: non-spacing characters
			\d: [0-9]
			\D: [^0-9]
			\l: [a-zA-Z]
			\L: [^a-zA-Z]
			\w: [a-zA-Z0-9_]
			\W: [^a-zA-Z0-9_]
			\.: any character (this is the main different from other regex, which treat "." as any characters and "\." as the dot character)
			\\, \/, \(, \), \+, \*, \?, \{, \}, \[, \], \<, \>, \^, \$, \!, \=: represents itself
		Escaped characters in charset defined in a square bracket:
			\r: the CR character
			\n: the LF character
			\t: the tab character
			\-, \[, \], \\, \/, \^, \$: represents itself
	4) Loops:
		regex{3}: repeats 3 times
		regex{3,}: repeats 3 or more times
		regex{1,3}: repeats 1 to 3 times
		regex?: repeats 0 or 1 times
		regex*: repeats 0 or more times
		regex+: repeats 1 or more times
		if you add a "?" right after a loop, it means repeating as less as possible (DFA incompatible)
	5) Capturing: (DFA incompatible)
		(regex): No capturing, just change the operators' association
		(?regex): Capture matched fragment
		(<name>regex): Capture matched fragment in a named group called "name"
		(<$i>): Match the i-th captured fragment, begins from 0
		(<$name;i>): Match the i-th captured fragment in the named group called "name", begins from 0
		(<$name>): Match any captured fragment in the named group called "name"
	6) MISC
		(=regex): The prefix of the following text should match the regex, but it is not counted in the whole match (DFA incompatible)
		(!regex): Any prefix of the following text should not match the regex, and it is not counted in the whole match (DFA incompatible)
		(<#name>regex): Name the regex "name", and it applies here
		(<&name>): Copy the named regex "name" here and apply
