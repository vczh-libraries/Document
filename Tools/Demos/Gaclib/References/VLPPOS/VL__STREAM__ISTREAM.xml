 Interface for streams. Stream functions are grouped into 5 categories:
 1) Feature testing functions.
 2) Read functions, available only if [M:vl.stream.IStream.CanRead] returns true.
 3) Peek functions, available only if [M:vl.stream.IStream.CanPeek] returns true.
 4) Write functions, available only if [M:vl.stream.IStream.CanWrite] returns true.
 5) Seek functions, available only if [M:vl.stream.IStream.CanSeek] returns true.
 6) Size functions, available only if [M:vl.stream.IStream.IsLimited] returns true. But there are still some streams knows that the content is limited, but the size is unknown. In this case, [M:vl.stream.IStream.Size] will return -1.
