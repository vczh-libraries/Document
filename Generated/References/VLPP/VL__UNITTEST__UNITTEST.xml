 Test cases could be defined in multiple cpp files. In each cpp file, there can be one <b>TEST_FILE</b> call.
 <program><code><![CDATA[
 TEST_FILE
 {
     // here could be multiple TEST_CATEGORY and TEST_CASE
 }
 ]]></code></program></p><p>
 Both <b>TEST_CATEGORY</b> could be used inside <b>TEST_FILE</b>, or nested inside another <b>TEST_CATEGORY</b>.
 <b>TEST_CASE</b> could be used inside <b>TEST_FILE</b> or <b>TEST_CATEGORY</b>.
 </p><p><b>TEST_ASSERT</b> is used to verify a boolean expression.
 It could only be used in <b>TEST_CASE</b>.
 <b>TEST_ASSERT</b> could not be used in <b>TEST_FILE</b> or <b>TEST_CATEGORY</b>.
 </p><p>
 When the test program is started in debug mode (Windows only), or by command line options &quot;/D&quot;,
 A <b>TEST_ASSERT</b> failure will trigger a break point, it could be catched by any debugger.
 </p><p>
 When the test program is started in release mode, or by command line options &quot;/R&quot;, or without command line options,
 A <b>TEST_ASSERT</b> failure will report an error and skip rest of the current <b>TEST_CASE</b>, the execution will continue.
 </p><p><b>TEST_ERROR</b> execute one statement, it fails when no <symbol name="Error" docId="vl::Error"/> is thrown.
 </p><p><b>TEST_EXCEPTION</b> execute one statement, it fails when the specified exception type is not thrown.
 Another callback will be called when the exception is thrown, given a chance to check data in the exception.
 </p><p><b>TEST_CASE_ASSERT</b> is an abbreviation of <b>TEST_CASE</b> + <b>TEST_ASSERT</b>.
 It is very common that are multiple independent assertions.
 </p><p><b>TEST_CASE_ASSERT</b> is a test case, it can be used in <b>TEST_CATEGORY</b> or <b>TEST_FILE</b>.
 In release mode, by failing this assertion, the execution does not stop.
 </p><p><b>TEST_CATEGORY</b> is very useful when multiple assertions do not have dependencies.
 During the execution of the test program, <b>TEST_FILE</b>, <b>TEST_CATEGORY</b>, <b>TEST_CASE</b> and failed <b>TEST_ASSERT</b> will be rendered with indentation and different colors.
 </p><p><symbol name="RunAndDisposeTests" docId="vl::unittest::UnitTest::RunAndDisposeTests@int(int, wchar_t * *)"/> is needed in the main function to execute test cases.
 <b>TEST_PRINT</b> could be used during test cases to print debug information to a command-line application.
