<Document accessor="" category="Class" name="WfRuntimeThreadContext"><summary>A Workflow script call stack.</summary><remarks><p>
 This object could be obtained by <symbol name="GetCurrentThreadContext"/>.
 A thread could have multiple thread contexts,
 a full list could be obtained by <symbol name="GetThreadContexts"/>.

 In the current version,
 the debug information doesn&apos;t contain enough data,
 so that it could be difficult to read local variables in high-level function constructions,
 like lambda expression or coroutines.
