 A closed token means that,
 there is a prefix that is a recognized token.
 At the same time, the input string itself could not be a token, or a prefix of any token.
 the recognized token has ended before reaching the end of the string.
 </p><p>
 An unrecognized token is also considered as closed.
 </p><p>
 For example, assume we have a token defined by &quot;/d+./d+&quot;:
 <ul><li>&quot;2&quot; is not a closed token, because it has not ended.</li><li>
         &quot;2.5.&quot; is a closed token, because it has ended at &quot;2.5&quot;,
         and &quot;2.5.&quot; could never be a prefix of any token,
         unless we have another token defined by &quot;/d+./d+./d+&quot;.
     </li></ul></p></remarks><example index="0"/><signature><![CDATA[bool IsClosedToken(
